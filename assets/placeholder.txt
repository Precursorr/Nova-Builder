This folder would normally contain ship images and UI icons.
For a real implementation, you would need to add actual image files here.

In the current implementation, the code references image paths like:
- assets/ship1.png
- assets/ship2.png
- etc.

These would need to be replaced with actual images for the application to display properly.
